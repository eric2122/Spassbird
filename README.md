# Feature of this website:
The website has been built with the aim of adding some fun to the usersâ€™ daily life. It has a huge database of a variety of jokes to make sure that no joke is repeated often.
It also keeps the users engaged by providing them an opportunity to contribute their own jokes. This helps us to grow the database and reach a larger audience.
The website is built using AWS Amplify with React.js. Amplify simplifies a lot of backend tasks like connection with the DynamoDB, Cognito, S3 storage and GraphQL API to fetch jokes and quotes.
The frontend of the website has a very user-friendly UI which is designed using Bootstrap CSS framework that provides a large variety of components like buttons, forms, div, carousels, etc which are easy to implement.
The registration process works with the Authentication UI on the homepage which integrates with the AWS Cognito at the backend which makes the website secure.
The website is deployed using Amplify by linking it directly to the Github repository. Amplify takes care of the continuous integration and continuous development. If there are any changes to the code in the Github repository the website in the cloud is automatically updated accordingly.
Possibilities for future improvements of the website:
Since the application is built using AWS Amplify, in future it can be extended to mobile devices by using React Native.
With the use of Cognito we can also implement further features like Multi Factor Authentication(MFA) and user profile management on the website.
We can also implement a functionality where users can also comment on a joke along with rating.
Also we can attract more users by giving out prizes for the users whose jokes make it to the top 10 jokes list.
